  <tr>
    <td>The strategies that I found effective were as well as Emad telling me what to write, Mr also looking at what I need to write down as some of it Emad was saying wrong so I couldn't follow it properly, also i learnt by efficiently writing down the instructions and paying attention to the work at hand.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my working was that i was making mistakes when working like putting 2 instead of " and 4 instead of $, so if i had worked that out earlier it would have been a much more productive lesson and we'd be further on in the booklet.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I  work to my full potential and i will make sure that i don't
 get my 2 and â€œ and 4 and $ mixed up. Also i will improve my learning by working with Emad better and communicating better</td>
