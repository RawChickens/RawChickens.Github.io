    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by following the code carefully and going at my own pace, even though i was going slow i soaked a lot of it in because of my slow pace and this will help me in the future. So a strategy that was effective was going slow and steady.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that limited my learning was actually my slow speed, because although i was going slow and soaking a lot of it in, i was not achieving the speed and level that i wanted to. So something that i need to work on is my speed at which i work at.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time i will have practised Python and become better and speedier at the code and hopefully i will improve my learning by practising for homework some of the levels and become a lot, lot better</td>
