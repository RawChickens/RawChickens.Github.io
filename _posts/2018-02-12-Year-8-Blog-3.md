    <td>I learnt by reading the booklet to the the end of each chapter before i start working on the first task, this strategy is effective as it makes it so that know what i'm working on</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my working was that i was making mistakes when working like putting 2 instead of " and 4 instead of $, so if i had worked that out earlier it would have been a much more productive lesson and we'd be further on in the booklet.</td>
